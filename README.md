# tSpace algorithm for unsupervised deteremination of multiple developmental branches in single cell data
By Denis Dermadi

Description

tSpace is the main function for trajectory inference. The algorithm is described in the publication (https://doi.org/10.1101/336313) 

Originally, it was developed for single cell analysis, however it can be applied on any type of large data.

# Installation

`devtools::install_github('hylasD/tSpace', build_vignettes=T)`


# How to use the algorithm

Vignette with a demo data is included in the package.
